    // (1) Create a socket connecting to the host and port set up above.
    // (2) Get the InputStream from the socket and "wrap it up"
    // (3) Get the OutputStream from the socket and "wrap it up"

    // This web page demonstrates how to set up the socket.
    // http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/networking/sockets/readingWriting.html
    // If you don't understand what this code is doing:
    //    (a) STOP
    //    (b) Review the I/O Streams readme.txt and sample code posted on GitHub
    //        https://github.com/kurmasz/CS371_SampleCode/tree/master/IOStreams
    //    (c) Ask questions.



    // (4) Send the GET request and the other request headers

    // Use the example client request on this page as a sample:
    // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol
    // (Go to the page and look for the section named "Example Session")
    //   (a) Remember that you need both the "GET" request and the "host" request header.
    //       The cis web server won't respond without both.
    //   (b) Don't forget to end with a blank line and flush the output stream.
    

    // (5) Read data from the socket until you get a blank line.
    //     Write each line you receive to System.out
    
    // (6) Create a FileOutputStream object.
    
    // (7) Read the rest of the data from the socket and write it to a file using
    //     the FileOutputStream you just created.
    
  } // end main
  
} // end class
